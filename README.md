For this assignment I refactored the html and css code for a website. One of the major changes I made was to use semantic html elements in place of non-semantic elements. For example I replaced several 'div' tags with 'section', 'header', 'footer', 'aside', 'nav', and 'main'. Making these semantic html changes required changes to the css as well. For example in the original code a   'div ' with a class="footer" is used, where the class .footer is used as the css selector. By changing the 'div' to a 'footer', I also had to remove the "footer" class and use the 'footer' tag as the css selector, i.e. footer { ...}. Similar changes were made for the other new tags. The other major changes I made was to the use of the id and class attributes. There were two id's which were not being used so I removed them. For the class changes, I noticed that the main content of the webpage was  split into three div's, each with their own unique classes, which all had identical css properties with the same values. Instead I gave the the three div's the same class, which got rid of the use of repeated css code. The side-bar also had the same repetion as the main content, and I made the same type of changes to it. The last changes I made were to add alt attributes to the images and give the website an appropriate title.
